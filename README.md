# HR Data Visualization Project

## Problem Statement

The HR Data Visualization project aims to analyze and represent HR data from the Forge platform, with a specific focus on gender-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The primary goal is to identify and discuss potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level. The dataset includes information about employees, such as age, gender, employment duration, promotion history, job roles, and more.

### Project Objectives:

1. **Define Relevant KPIs:**
   - Design visualizations to represent HR data, focusing on the following key areas:
     - Hiring
     - Promotion
     - Performance
     - Turnover

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Identify and discuss potential root causes contributing to the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level. This analysis will involve a deep dive into the HR data to understand patterns and trends.

### HR Data Overview:

The dataset (`03_Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx`) includes essential HR-related information, such as:
- Employee age
- Gender
- Joining and leaving dates
- Promotion year
- Job roles
- Other relevant data points

### Power BI Measures:

In the process of creating visualizations, various measures were implemented in Power BI, including but not limited to:
- `# of men`
- `# of women`
- `# of leavers`
- `% employees promoted (FY21)`
- `% of women promoted`
- `% of hires men`
- `% of hires women`
- `% turnover`
- `Average performance rating: men`
- `Average performance rating: women`

### Repository Files:

The repository is organized with the following files:

- **Data Source:**
  - The dataset is stored in `03_Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx`.

- **Power BI Dashboard (Dynamic):**
  - The Power BI file containing interactive and dynamic visualizations is named `call_centre_diversity.pbix`.

- **Power BI Dashboard (Static):**
  - A static version of the Power BI dashboard is available in PDF format (`call_centre_diversity.pdf`).

- **README.md:**
  - The main README file providing an overview of the project, problem statement, dataset details, Power BI measures, and instructions.
