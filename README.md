## Problem Statement

The HR Data Visualization project aims to analyze and represent HR data from the Forge platform, with a specific focus on gender-related Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The primary goal is to identify and discuss potential root causes for the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level. The dataset includes information about employees, such as age, gender, employment duration, promotion history, job roles, and more.

### Project Objectives:

1. **Define Relevant KPIs:**
   - Design visualizations to represent HR data, focusing on the following key areas:
     - Hiring
     - Promotion
     - Performance
     - Turnover

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Identify and discuss potential root causes contributing to the slow progress in achieving gender balance at the executive management level. This analysis will involve a deep dive into the HR data to understand patterns and trends.

### HR Data Overview:

The dataset (`03_Diversity-Inclusion-Dataset.xlsx`) includes essential HR-related information, such as:
- Employee age
- Gender
- Joining and leaving dates
- Promotion year
- Job roles
- Other relevant data points

### Power BI Measures:

In the process of creating visualizations, various measures were implemented in Power BI, including but not limited to:
- `# of men`
- `# of women`
- `# of leavers`
- `% employees promoted (FY21)`
- `% of women promoted`
- `% of hires men`
- `% of hires women`
- `% turnover`
- `Average performance rating: men`
- `Average performance rating: women`

 ## Power BI Dashboard (Dynamic)

Explore the interactive Power BI dashboard created to visualize various KPIs and metrics. The dashboard includes the following key performance indicators (KPIs), providing insights into different aspects of HR data:

1. **KPI 1 - Hiring:**
   - Visualize hiring trends and metrics to understand recruitment patterns.

2. **KPI 2 - Promotions (this year):**
   - Analyze promotions that occurred within the current year to track career progression.

3. **KPI 3 - Turnover Rate (FY20 leavers):**
   - Evaluate the turnover rate based on data from employees who left in FY20.

4. **KPI 4 - Performance Rating:**
   - Explore performance ratings across the organization to assess employee performance.

5. **KPI 5 - Executive Gender Balance:**
   - Assess the gender balance at the executive management level.

6. **KPI 6 - Age Group:**
   - Understand the distribution of employees across different age groups.

### Slicers for Data Adjustment:

The dashboard is equipped with slicers, allowing users to dynamically adjust the displayed data based on specific criteria. Slicers include:

- **Age:** Filter data based on age groups to gain insights into different generational patterns.

- **Department:** Analyze HR metrics specific to different departments within the organization.

- **Job Level:** Explore KPIs based on various job levels to understand performance across different roles.

- **Region:** Evaluate regional variations in HR metrics by using the region slicer.

Adjusting these slicers provides a customized view of the HR data, enabling a more focused and detailed analysis.
